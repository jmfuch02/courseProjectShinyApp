Mortgage Calculator Documentation
=======================

## Introduction

This application shows how a mortgage loan is amortized over the life of the loan. You may select

1. An amount to finance

2. A length of time to pay back the loan

3. An interest rate

The chart at right will update to show you how much principal is left at each month of the loan.

## Disclaimer

Although all of the shiny functionality is my own work, the function that actually calculates the amortization schedule is not. It was written by Thomas Girke and sourced from http://faculty.ucr.edu/~tgirke/Documents/R_BioCond/My_R_Scripts/mortgage.R
